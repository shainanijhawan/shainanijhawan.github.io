	<h2>About Shaina</h2>
		<p>I am Shaina Nijhawan, a third year undergraduate at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was born and bred here in Madison, just a few minutes from campus. I really love animals, fashion, listening to music, going out to eat, and spending time with my family and friends. To hear some of my favorite music, visit: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ka8iybm62tmhqe1tq1zhpxdou"> https://open.spotify.com/user/ka8iybm62tmhqe1tq1zhpxdou
